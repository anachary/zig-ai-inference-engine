# Zig AI Platform

A zero-dependency AI inference library for all model formats. Built as a DLL with real GGUF model support.

## What is this

The zig-ai-platform is a production-ready AI inference library that loads and runs models from multiple formats - starting with GGUF, expanding to ONNX, SafeTensors, PyTorch, and more. Unlike other libraries, it's built as a **dynamic library (DLL)** that applications can consume, with zero dependencies beyond the Zig standard library.

**Key Features:**
- 🚀 **Real GGUF model loading** with actual tensor data access
- 📦 **DLL architecture** - library + applications (CLI, etc.)
- 🔍 **Smart tensor organization** - automatically structures transformer weights
- 💾 **Memory efficient** - explicit allocations, no hidden malloc calls
- 🎯 **Format detection** - automatic model format identification
- ⚡ **Performance focused** - SIMD optimizations and zero-cost abstractions

## Why Zig

Zig gives us the performance of C with the safety of modern languages, plus unique advantages for AI workloads:

- **Comptime computation** - optimize models at build time
- **Explicit memory management** - no hidden allocations in inference loops
- **Cross compilation** - works out of the box for web, mobile, embedded
- **Zero cost abstractions** - clean APIs without performance penalties
- **No dependencies** - pure Zig standard library only

├── 🖥️ zig-out/bin/zig-ai-cli.exe         # CLI application
├── 📁 models/                            # Real GGUF models

└── 📁 examples/                          # Example applications
```

### **Real Model Loading Pipeline**
```zig
// 1. Load real GGUF model
var model = try zig_ai.loadModel(allocator, "model.gguf");

// 2. Access organized tensors
const embeddings = model.getTensor("token_embd.weight");
const layer0_attn = model.getTensor("blk.0.attn_q.weight");

// 3. Run real transformer inference
var transformer = try RealTransformer.init(allocator, &model);
const logits = try transformer.forward(tokens, &context);

// 4. Sample next token
const next_token = try transformer.sample(logits, &config);
```

## Memory Management Philosophy

**Everything is explicit. No hidden allocations:**

```zig
// Always explicit about memory
var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
defer _ = gpa.deinit();
const allocator = gpa.allocator();

// Load model with explicit allocator
var model = try zig_ai.loadModel(allocator, "model.gguf");
defer model.deinit();

// No hidden allocations in inference
const result = try transformer.forward(tokens, &context);
defer allocator.free(result);
```

## Building & Usage

### **Build the Library and CLI**
```bash
zig build                    # Builds both DLL and CLI
```

### **Test with Real Models**
```bash
# Detect model format
zig build run -- detect models/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf

# Start interactive chat
zig build run -- chat models/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

### **Use as Library**
```zig
// Link against zig-ai-platform.dll
const zig_ai = @import("zig-ai-platform");

// C API for other languages
extern fn zig_ai_get_version() [*:0]const u8;
extern fn zig_ai_detect_format(path: [*:0]const u8) c_int;
