## 🚀 Getting Started

### How do I get started quickly?
1. **Quick Demo**: Follow our [Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md) (5 minutes)
2. **IoT Deployment**: Try [IoT Quick Start](deployment/IOT_QUICK_START_GUIDE.md) (15 minutes)
3. **Cloud Deployment**: Follow [LLM Quick Start](deployment/QUICK_START_LLM_DEPLOYMENT.md) (30 minutes)

### What are the system requirements?
**Minimum Requirements:**
- **CPU**: x86_64 or ARM64
- **Memory**: 128MB RAM (for small models)
- **Storage**: 100MB free space
- **OS**: Linux, macOS, Windows

**Recommended for Production:**
- **CPU**: 4+ cores
- **Memory**: 4GB+ RAM
- **Storage**: 10GB+ free space
- **Network**: Stable internet for distributed deployment

### Do I need to know Zig to use this?
No! You can use the platform through:
- **HTTP API**: RESTful API for any programming language
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line interface for operations
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment
- **Kubernetes**: Cloud-native deployment

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

### How does the modular architecture work?
The platform consists of 5 independent components:
- **🧮 zig-tensor-core**: Tensor operations and memory management
- **📦 zig-onnx-parser**: Model format handling
- **⚙️ zig-inference-engine**: Neural network execution
- **🌐 zig-model-server**: HTTP API & CLI
- **🎯 zig-ai-platform**: Unified orchestration

Each component can be used independently or together.

### Can I use just one component?
Yes! Each component is designed for independent use:
```zig
// Use just tensor operations
const tensor_core = @import("zig-tensor-core");

// Use just ONNX parsing
const onnx_parser = @import("zig-onnx-parser");

// Use just inference engine
const inference = @import("zig-inference-engine");
```

### How does distributed inference work?
Distributed inference splits large models across multiple VMs:
- **Layer-wise Sharding**: Split model layers across nodes
- **Automatic Load Balancing**: Distribute inference requests
- **Fault Tolerance**: Handle node failures gracefully
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add/remove nodes dynamically

## 🚀 Deployment

### What deployment options are available?
- **🏠 Local**: Single machine deployment
- **📱 IoT/Edge**: Raspberry Pi, embedded devices
- **☁️ Cloud**: Azure AKS, AWS EKS, Google GKE
- **🌐 Distributed**: Multi-node cluster deployment
- **🐳 Container**: Docker and Kubernetes

### How do I deploy on Kubernetes?

- **Small Models**: 1-10ms latency
- **Medium Models**: 10-100ms latency
- **Large Models**: 100ms-1s latency
- **Throughput**: 5000+ requests/second

### How much memory does it use?
Memory usage is optimized:
- **Base Platform**: ~50MB
- **Small Models**: 100MB-1GB
- **Large Models**: 1GB-100GB (distributed)
- **50% less** than Python frameworks
