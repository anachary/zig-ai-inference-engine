# Models Directory

This directory is for storing ONNX model files.

## Usage

Download models using the CLI:
```bash
zig build cli -- download --download-model tinyllama
```

Or place your own ONNX models here and reference them:
```bash
zig build cli -- interactive --model ./models/your-model.onnx
```

## Built-in Model

The engine includes a built-in model that works without any downloads:
```bash
zig build cli -- interactive --model built-in
```
