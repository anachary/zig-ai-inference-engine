# Changelog

All notable changes to the Zig AI Interface Engine project will be documented in this file.

## [Phase 1.1] - 2025-06-27 - STABILITY FIXES

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Fixes
- **FIXED**: Memory corruption in operator registry causing segmentation faults
- **FIXED**: Memory leaks in tensor management system
- **FIXED**: OperatorNotFound errors preventing operator execution
- **FIXED**: All tests now pass (100% success rate)

### âœ… What's Working Now
- `zig build test` - All tests pass without errors
- `zig build run-simple_inference` - Complete working example demonstrating:
  - Tensor creation and manipulation
  - Element-wise operations (Add)
  - Activation functions (ReLU)
  - Matrix multiplication (MatMul)
  - Memory management and cleanup
  - Operator registry functionality

### ðŸ”§ Technical Changes

#### Memory Management
- Added `cleanup_tensor()` method for immediate tensor deallocation
- Updated examples to use proper `defer` cleanup patterns
- Fixed tensor pool memory management issues

#### Operator Registry
- Removed stored pointer from `ExecutionContext` to prevent memory corruption
- Modified `execute_operator()` to accept registry as parameter
- Ensured stable memory references throughout execution

#### Testing
- Updated all tests to use proper memory cleanup
- Fixed memory leak detection in test suite
- All 20+ tests now pass consistently

### ðŸ“Š Performance
- Memory usage: Stable with proper cleanup (0 bytes leaked)
- Execution: All operators function correctly
- SIMD: AVX2 optimizations working as expected

### ðŸ“š Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with current working status
- Updated GETTING_STARTED.md with accurate build instructions
- Added TROUBLESHOOTING.md with detailed fix documentation
- Updated IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md with lessons learned

## [Phase 1.0] - 2025-06-26 - FOUNDATION COMPLETE

### âœ… Initial Implementation
- Complete tensor system with multi-dimensional arrays
- SIMD-optimized operations (AVX2/SSE/NEON)
- Memory management with pools and tracking
- Core operators: Add, Sub, Mul, ReLU, MatMul, Softmax
- Operator registry and execution framework
- Hardware capability detection
- Comprehensive test suite
- Zero external ML framework dependencies

### ðŸš§ Known Issues (Fixed in 1.1)
- Memory corruption in operator registry
- Memory leaks in tensor management
- Some tests failing due to memory issues

## Upcoming

## Development Notes

### Version Numbering
- Phase X.Y format where X is the major phase and Y is the minor update
- Each phase represents a major milestone in functionality
- Minor updates represent bug fixes and stability improvements

### Testing Strategy
- All changes must pass the complete test suite
- Memory leak detection is mandatory
- Performance regression testing for critical paths
- Integration testing for end-to-end workflows

### Quality Gates
- âœ… All tests pass
- âœ… No memory leaks
- âœ… No segmentation faults
- âœ… Working examples demonstrate functionality
